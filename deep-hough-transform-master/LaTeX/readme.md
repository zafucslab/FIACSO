## LaTeX source code

This folder contains the LaTeX source codes that are used to produce our paper.

Run `bash build.sh` to generate the PDF paper and `bash clean.sh` to delete generated PDFs and
auxiliary files.

A generated PDF can be found [here](http://data.kaizhao.net/publications/tpami2021line.pdf).

*Codes are tested on Win10 and Ubuntu20LTS with TexLive2020.*
